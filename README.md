# ZoomImage-SwiftUI
A basic pinch-to-zoom image view for swiftUI

You can use this SwiftUI View to display an image at the proper aspect, zoomed in to default width or height of the screen, depending on image aspect.  Then you can pinch to zoom and swipe to move around the image.

Usage is self-explanatory... just put this in a .sheet, or navigationView as needed.  All you need to pass in is the UIImage you want to display.
